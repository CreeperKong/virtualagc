The file TicTacToe.agc was taken, with permission, from [Neil Fraser 
and Lena Ku's repository](https://github.com/NeilFraser/AGC-code), 
for incorporation into the VirtualAGC GUI.  The remainder of the 
files in this folder were added by me in support of that end.

There is no automatic mechnism for sync'ing updates in the official
repository linked here, and I'm lazy, so you may find newer versions
TicTacToe.agc at the linked site than the version here.

The linked repository may also have other AGC apps than Tic-Tac-Toe
which I've not (yet?) imported into VirtualAGC.

The file TicTacToe.agc was taken, with permission, from [Neil Fraser 
and Lena Ku's repository](https://github.com/NeilFraser/AGC-code), 
for incorporation into the VirtualAGC GUI.  The remainder of the 
files in this folder were added by me in support of that end.

There is no automatic mechanism for sync'ing the version here with
updates to the official repository, and I'm lazy, so you may find 
newer versions of TicTacToe.agc in the linked repository.

The linked repository also has at least one AGC app other than 
Tic-Tac-Toe which I've not (yet?) imported into VirtualAGC.

    <h1><a name="WhatsThis"></a>What's this Virtual Machine?</h1>
    <p>This Virtual Machine (VM), called VirtualAGC-VM64, is intended to
      provide an easy and portable way to work with the materials from
      the Virtual AGC Project, and to update it, without the
      inconvenience of having to deal with complex installation
      instructions or the quirks of the various computer platforms
      (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, <i>et al.</i>, in multiple
      operating-system versions) that Virtual AGC targets.&nbsp; I won't
      describe the Virtual AGC Project itself in any detail here, since
      if you don't have a pretty good idea already what it is, then you
      can be assured that you don't need this VM at all and can stop
      reading right here.&nbsp; It suffices to say that the project
      provides information, software (both original and modern), and
      engineering drawings related to the flight computers used in the
      Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle spacecraft and launch vehicles.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With this VM you'll be able to run all of the software provided
      by the Virtual AGC project, as well as to view Apollo guidance
      system electrical schematics and to perform electrical simulations
      of its digital circuity.&nbsp; For example, you <i>could</i>
      simulate electrical operation of an Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)
      running its original software.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The VM itself is running <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://lubuntu.me/">a light-weight version of the 64-bit
        Ubuntu Linux operating system that's known as Lubuntu</a>.&nbsp;
      The VM can be run on any computer for which there's a version of <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://virtualbox.org">the
        VirtualBox virtualization environment</a>, or some common
      alternatives to it, but you likely know that already since you're
      viewing this message.<br>

    <h1><a name="JoystickSetup"></a>Setup of VirtualBox<br>
    </h1>
    <p>I doubt if most people using modern computers will need any setup
      to use the Virtual AGC VM, beyond whatever you've <i>already</i>
      done to be reading this pleasant little note.&nbsp; However, there
      are some optional things you might want to do.&nbsp; If so, shut
      down the VM, if it's running, and look at VirtualBox's settings
      for the VirtualAGC-VM64 VM:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As delivered, the VM is set up to use 4 CPU cores.&nbsp; This
        can be changed in the VirtualBox Settings/System/Processor
        window.&nbsp; I have run it with 1 CPU core without any apparent
        difficulty, but this is nevertheless the case of "more is
        better".<br>
      </li>
      <li>Also as delivered, the VM is set to use 4GB of memory.&nbsp;
        This can be changed in the VirtualBox
        Settings/System/Motherboard window.&nbsp; I have run it with 1GB
        without any apparent problem.</li>
      <li>If you want to use a USB joystick to simulate the Apollo LM
        Attitude Controller Assembly (ACA, also referred to as the
        rotational hand controller, or RHC), attach it to your computer
        and look at the VirtualBox Settings/USB window.&nbsp; Use the
        hot-buttons there to add a new "USB Device Filter", choosing
        your joystick from the list you're presented with.&nbsp; Note
        that while the VM is running, it will by default take control of
        any of the devices listed in "USB Device Filters" away from your
        host computer, and only return control after shutting down the
        VM.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Warning:</b>&nbsp; My own personal 3D
        joystick seems to be misidentified by some software within the
        VM as a tablet (i.e., a touchpad).&nbsp; So while it can be used
        as a ACA/RHC, it may also just cause random stuff to occur on
        the desktop as long as it's enabled.&nbsp; Which makes using it
        less appealing for me.&nbsp; Whether that's the case on your
        computer with your 3D joystick, who knows?</font><br>

    <h1><a name="WhatsNot"></a>What's Not In this Virtual Machine?</h1>
    <p>The original documentation for Gemini, Apollo, and the Space
      Shuttle is not directly provided within the VM due to size
      constraints.&nbsp; (I assume you wouldn't want to deal with
      multi-terabyte downloads of the VM!)&nbsp; Refer instead to
      Virtual AGC's online <a moz-do-not-send="true"

        Shuttle document library</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Flight software for Gemini is not provided, because no surviving
      copy has ever been discovered.&nbsp; Some short programs created
      for us by a couple of the original Gemini software developers are
      present.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Flight software for the Apollo Launch Vehicle Digital Computer
      (LVDC) and the Space Shuttle General Purpose Computers (GPC) are
      not publicly provided due to <i>presumed</i> "export"
      restrictions under the International Trade in Arms Regulations
      (ITAR).&nbsp; It is hoped that at some point we can acquire either
      export licenses or else a ruling that no export licenses are
      needed, at which point the flight software will be included via an
      update.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Virtual AGC related software created by developers external to
      the Virtual AGC Project that's specific to the Windows or Mac OS
      platforms is not provided since it cannot be run on a Linux
      platform.<br>

        software mentioned in the paragraph above falls into that
        category.&nbsp; There is an article in the Orbiter Wiki (see the
        next section) that explains how to run an out-of-date version of
        Orbiter on Linux using WINE, so perhaps some day Orbiter w/NASSP

    <h1><a name="Lubuntu"></a>Working With Lubuntu</h1>
    <p>You're unlikely to be familiar with Lubuntu, but be confident
      that unfamiliarity won't matter very much to you.&nbsp; Since this
      VM is not intended to be a full-fledged system for you to do your
      daily work or obtain your non-AGC-related entertainment, it
      doesn't have much software installed on it that isn't directly
      relevant to the Virtual AGC Project.&nbsp; But it doesn't need
      much, and hopefully this short section will familiarize you almost
      everything you do need to know.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As delivered, the desktop is configured so that a <i>single
          click</i> on any file opens it, similar to a web browser. If
        you prefer <i>double clicking</i>, as is the default for most
        operating systems, you can easily configure it. Open the
        file-system navigator by clicking on the <img
          moz-do-not-send="true" src="system-file-manager.svg" alt=""
          height="24"> icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the desktop.
        Use Edit/Preferences on the navigator's menu, and uncheck the
        box labeled "Open files with single click".</li>
      <li>Lubuntu's main menu is opened by using the icon that looks
        like&nbsp;<img moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="Lubuntu_logo_only.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24"> in
        the lower-left corner of the screen.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Web browser: Firefox is found on the Lubuntu main menu under
        the heading "Internet".</li>
      <li>Text editor: Several are installed (FeatherPad, Vim), on the
        Lubuntu main menu under the heading "Accessories", or obtained
        by right-clicking on a text file.&nbsp; I would recommend
        FeatherPad for ease of use, but some people may prefer Vim its
        more-advanced capabilities.</li>
      <li>Screenshots: I'd recommend using the VirtualBox View menu to
        make screenshots, rather than using Lubuntu's facilities or the
        facilities of the host computer.</li>
      <li>Recordings: The VirtualBox View menu has a Recording option
        you can use, and it is functional, but it's tricky to configure
        and use, so I wouldn't recommend using it if you already have
        decent screen-recording software on the host computer.<br>
      </li>
      <li>System snapshots: If you have configured the VM how you like
        it and are considering doing anything which might adversely
        affect it (such as performing a Lubuntu update), you might want
        to make a snapshot of your current VM configuration before doing
        so. I would recommend using VirtualBox's snapshotting capability
        rather than attempting to install or use any native Lubuntu
        backup facilities for that purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a name="LubuntuUpdates"></a>Lubuntu Updates</h1>
    Regarding Lubuntu updates, I recommend <i>not</i> performing them
    routinely.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    It is important to update Lubuntu from time to time, because
    otherwise the VM may become so out-of-date with respect to the
    official Virtual AGC build process that Virtual AGC itself can no
    longer be built within the VM.&nbsp; On the other hand, updates to
    Lubuntu risk breaking Virtual AGC updates as well.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>For example</b>, you will find in
        Lubuntu-update notifications you receive that the package "bnfc"
        is marked as "held", which means that it wouldn't be updated
        along with the rest of Lubuntu.&nbsp; That's because I have
        deliberately installed an out-of-date bnfc package, in order to
        prevent breakage of a specific space-shuttle program called
        yaHAL-S-FC.py.&nbsp; I've marked the bnfc package as "held" to
        make sure that doesn't happen.&nbsp; If somehow a newer version
        does get installed, and the Virtual AGC updater is broken by
        that, the procedure is to reinstall the obsolete version of the
        package and then re-mark it as "held":</font><br>
      <blockquote>
        <pre># Recall that the password for `sudo` is "virtualagc".<br>sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/bnfc_2.8.3-1build1.1_amd64.deb<br>sudo apt-mark hold bnfc<br></pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>If you make system snapshots in advance, as mentioned in the
      preceding section, you can then perform system updates without
      fear, since you can always roll back a failed update.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My <i>hope</i> is that I will remember to test the VM regularly,
      and to post advice about Lubuntu updates that are recommended or
      inadvisable.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true"

    <h1><a name="kicad"></a>Working With Apollo GNC Electrical
      Schematics<br>
    </h1>
    <p>Here's a tiny smidgen of useful introductory info about viewing
      the CAD files for the Apollo Guidance, Navigation &amp; Control
      (GNC) System electrical schematics in the Virtual AGC VM.<br>
    </p>
    <p>At present, there are about 140 CAD files available, referenced
      by their original drawing numbers.&nbsp; Unfortunately — for
      example —, while you can easily see that we present you with
      drawing 2005260A, there's not yet any way within the VM that you
      can tell at a glance that drawing 2005260A represents "logic
      module A2" in the AGC of Apollo 11's Lunar Module.&nbsp; In other
      words, there's nothing here in the VM that says to you "Drawing
      2005260A is relevant to me and I want to look at it!"&nbsp; That's
      a deficiency I hope to correct in the future.&nbsp; In the
      meantime, what you have is the ability to work in the opposite
      direction:&nbsp; You can use our online <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ElectroMechanical.html#Search_by_Drawing_Number_or_Title_">drawing-tree



        lookup facility</a> to choose "Apollo 11 Lunar Module" to reach
      drawing 2014999-101 of the GN&amp;C system, then choose "COMPUTER
      ASSEMBLY" to reach drawing 2003993-031, at which point you can
      select "LOGIC MODULE A2" to reach drawing 2003888-021, and finally
      you'll see that it has the electrical schematic 2005260A, which
      you can view either in its scanned form or as an image exported
      from the CAD file ... or know to view the actual CAD file here in
      the VM.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You may perhaps wonder <i>why</i> you would want to view these
      CAD files here in the VM, using EDA software you're not familiar
      with, as opposed to simply looking at the images I just now told
      you we provide online anyway!&nbsp; Well, aside from the fun
      factor, you have useful capabilities within the CAD system that
      you wouldn't otherwise have just from viewing the images of the
      drawings.&nbsp; For example, you perform searches on component
      reference designators or net names, or even on resistor values or
      component types.&nbsp; Or you can generate netlist files in a
      variety of formats.&nbsp; Or you can highlight a given electrical
      net, with the highlighting extending even across multiple pages of
      the drawing, making it much easier to see how the interconnections
      work.&nbsp; In the screenshot below, you see a net that's
      highlighted <font color="#cc33cc">like so</font>.<br>

        The CAD files can be directly used in later versions of KiCad,
        but you may see a harmless warning banner reading "This file was
        created by an older versions of KiCad. It will be converted to
        the new format when saved".</li>
      <li>The schematics for any given drawing tend to consist of
        multiple pages, consisting of a top-level CAD file (always
        called module.kicad_sch) and supplemental pages that represent
        either separate "sheets" of the original drawing or else
        reusable "blocks".&nbsp; So when you open a drawing, you
        sometimes just see some rectangular objects with markings like
        Page 1 or Page 2.&nbsp; You can descend into these extra sheets
        or blocks by double-clicking them.</li>
      <li>You can zoom in or zoom out using a mouse scroll-wheel.</li>
      <li>To pan, you hold in the <i>rightmost</i> mouse button while
        moving the mouse.&nbsp; (Holding the leftmost mouse button is
        used for selecting rectangular areas.)</li>
      <li>To do any of the stuff just mentioned, you have to be in
        "Select" mode, which means that the cursor looks like an
        arrowhead.&nbsp; You activate this mode using the up-arrow
        hotbutton on the toolbar to the right of the drawing (as in the
        image to the right).&nbsp; The hotbutton immediately below that
        instead enables the "Highlight" mode that I used in the
        screenshot above having a highlighted net.</li>
      <li>The electrical schematics for which desktop icons are provided
        are directly related to the original paper drawings are stored
        in <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="file:///home/virtualagc/git/virtualagc-schematics/Schematics/">this




          folder</a>, while alternate schematics intended to convey the
        correct functionality without corresponding to any specific
        original drawing are instead in <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="file:///home/virtualagc/git/virtualagc-schematics/msSchematics/">this




          folder</a>.&nbsp; Note that the alternate drawings haven't
        been endowed with any convenient links from the desktop, so you
        have to navigate to them in a file browser and explicitly run <b>eeschema</b>
        yourself if you're interested in them.&nbsp; The top-level
        schematic file for any given drawing is called
        "module.kicad_sch".</li>

    <h1><a name="verilog"></a>Working With Verilog Electrical Simulation
      of the AGC</h1>
    <p>The Verilog-based simulation process for Virtual AGC is <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Verilog.html">described in
        detail online here</a>.&nbsp; Note that in this VM, the CAD
      files for the electrical schematics are stored in the folder
      ~/git/virtualagc-schematics/Schematics/.&nbsp; So for example,
      where the online description mentions (say) the testVerilog/
      folder, it's really talking about
      ~/git/virtualagc-schematics/Schematics/testVerilog/.<br>
      <br>
      The simulation process is largely automated, so you usually don't
      need to know too much about the details of how it works.&nbsp; The
      most-likely thing you'd want to do, I think, is to simulate some
      model of the Block II AGC, running some particular AGC
      software.&nbsp; In brief, you'd do this from a command line, using
      the commands:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><font color="#663300">cd ~/git/virtualagc-schematics/Schematics<br>simulateAGC <i>AGC_MODEL</i> <i>AGC_SOFTWARE</i> "<i>VERILOG_OPTIONS</i>"</font><br></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here, <font color="#663300"><code><i>AGC_MODEL</i></code></font>
      is the particular model number of the AGC, of which there are a
      variety, but only models 2003200 (no flown missions) and 2003993
      (all flown Block II missions) are currently available for
      simulation purposes.&nbsp; If "" is used (or if there are no
      command-line parameters at all), the default is 2003993.&nbsp;
      Block I models will hopefully be supported at some point later,
      via an update.<br>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i><code>AGC_SOFTWARE</code></i></font> is
      the name of the AGC software the simulated CPU runs.&nbsp; Only
      the following are currently available for simulation
      purposes:&nbsp; Artemis072, Aurora12, Borealis, Colossus237,
      Colossus249, Comanche055, Luminary099, Luminary116, Luminary131,
      Luminary210, Retread44, Sunburst120, Sunburst37, SuperJob,
      Validation, and Validation-hardware-simulation.&nbsp;
      Validation-hardware-simulation is the default if "" is used (or if
      the 2nd and 3rd command-line parameters of <b>simulateAGC</b> are
      omitted).<br>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#663300"><code>"<i>VERILOG_OPTIONS</i>"</code></font>
      is a quoted, space-separated list of command-line options for the
      Verilog compiler that creates the simulation.&nbsp; It can be left
      blank.&nbsp; Some of the useful options are:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-DRUNLENGTH=<i>N</i></code></font>,
        where <i><font color="#663300"><code>N</code></font></i> is the
        length of the simulation run in nanoseconds.&nbsp; The default
        is 250000000 (i.e., 250 milliseconds or 0.25 seconds).</li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-DDUMP_DECODER</code></font>,
        which means that the simulation should log only the ~80 signals
        needed to decode CPU instructions.</li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-DDUMP_HELPFUL</code></font>,
        which means that the simulation should log the ~150 signals
        needed to decode CPU instructions, plus the CPU registers A, L,
        Z, S, EB, and FB.</li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-DDUMP_BACKPLANE</code></font>,
        which means that the simulation should log the ~2000 signals
        appearing on the AGC backplane.</li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-DDUMP_ALL</code></font>, which
        means that the simulation should log <i>all</i> ~5000 signals
        in the AGC.&nbsp; This is the default.</li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-DSPOOF_SC</code></font>, which
        means to simulate certain signals input to the AGC from the
        spacecraft, which does not occur by default.</li>
      <li><font color="#663300"><code>-Pagc.GATE_DELAY=</code><code><i>N</i></code></font>,
        which means to set the logic-gate propagation delay to <font
          color="#663300"><i><code>N</code></i></font>
        nanoseconds.&nbsp; The default is 20.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In choosing from among these various parameters, note that the
      output log of the simulation, which is a file called agc.fst, has
      a size <i>very</i> roughly equal to 20 bytes, times the run
      length in milliseconds, times the number of signals logged.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>

    <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; Telemetry documentation for this specific Command
    Module software version is not (yet) available, most likely due to
    an unavailable <i>Guidance System Operations Plan</i> (GSOP) for
    it.&nbsp; Only those telemetered items which are essentially the
    same across all software versions are described herein, while those
    items which differ significantly by software version are
    omitted.&nbsp; Nevertheless, even the behavior of those items
    included here may still differ in subtle ways from one AGC software
    version to another, so do not assume that the generic documentation
    herein is perfectly reliable.&nbsp; Careful examination of the
    source code for the AGC software version, if available, may provide
    additional detail in resolving questions; refer particularly to

    <p>CSM STATE VECTOR and TIME. The CMC's latest calculated state
      vector for the CSM in either earth-centered or moon-centered
      reference coordinates. During the Orbital Integration Routine, the
      sphere of influence will be indicated by Flagword 8, bit 12
      (CMOONFLG): zero = earth-centered; one = lunar-centered.&nbsp; It
      is important to note that the Average-G routine is initialized
      with a state in RN, VN which can have a different origin than is
      indicated by CMOONFLG. This means an inconsistency in the Downlink
      of the state vector actual origin and CMOONFLG origin. Words 2-4
      contain the position components, X, Y, Z, scaled meters/2<sup>29</sup>,
      Words 5-7 contain the velocity components, X, Y, Z, scaled
      (meters/centisecond)/2<sup>7</sup>. Word 8 contains the time
      associated with the CSM state vector in words 2-7, scaled
      centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>, referenced to the computer clock.
      These parameters are calculated whenever the CSM state vector is
      permanently extrapolated or changed<br>
    </p>
    <h1><a name="10"></a>9a,9b,10a</h1>
    <p>CDUX (outer gimbal) CDUY (inner gimbal) CDUZ (middle gimbal): The
      actual values of the IMU CDU angles. Each register is an unsigned
      15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated by counter
      interrupts. A middle gimbal angle greater than 70 degrees will
      light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. Whenever the magnitude of
      the MGA exceeds 85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop will be
      disabled. As a result, the CDUZ register should maintain values
      that correspond to middle gimbal angles between -70 degrees and
      +70 degrees.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>10b</h1>
    <p>CDUT. The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled (degrees -
      19.7754)/45 (two's complement). The angle varies from -19.775° to
      +45°. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>11-13</h1>
    <p>ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP on).
      ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e. the
      outputs from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw, about
      the control axes. These axes are aligned with the RCS jet quads
      and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV base axes,
      -7.25 degrees about +X. ADOTs are scaled, (degrees/second)/450.
      OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured roll rate obtained by
      back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA) measurements every
      0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>, This quantity will
      normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet failed-on could
      produce 2-3°/sec rates. OMEGABS, in words 12 and 13, are the
      measured pitch and yaw attitude rates about the body axes,
      obtained by back-differencing the CDU readings every TVC DAP
      sample period. The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the
      same as for the OMEGACs, described in words 85-87 of the Powered
      downlist. The maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>14a,14b,15a</h1>
    <p>AKs. The X, Y and Z (roll, pitch and yaw, respectively) attitude
      errors used to drive the FDAI display, scaled degrees/180, The
      roll attitude error register (AK +0) is loaded with one-quarter
      the "raw" value during P11 (and entry programs while Entry DAP is
      running, although the cell is not telemetered then) to increase
      the scale by a factor of four. The attitude errors are about the
      control axes for RCS DAP and about the body axes for TVC and Entry
      DAP. Zeros in bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in bit 2 of
      Flagword 6 indicate that the Entry DAP is active, During RCS DAP
      operation the particular error quantities depend upon the display
      mode selected, as follows: MODE 1 (selected by V61) results in
      Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected by V62) results in
      total attitude errors with respect to the angles in N22; MODE 3
      (selected by V63) results in total astronaut attitude errors with
      respect to the angles in N17, In MODE 1 the errors should
      generally remain less than the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5
      degree or 5 degrees as selected in DAPDATR1). The values are
      calculated every 200 ms during RCS DAP operation, whereas in TVC
      DAP operation, AK is updated every 0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE
      with the current value of OGA, and AK 1 and AK 2 are updated every
      TVC DAP sample period (in PCOPY and YCOPY) with the respective
      values of ERRBTMP. Also, with TVC DAP, AK will normally have a
      magnitude of less than 5 degrees but a jet failed-on could produce
      larger angles.<br>

            at any time when the bit is 1 (subsequent computations,

            program; reset to 0 if LAMBERT is to calculate its own unit
            normal vector (by crossing the initial and final position
            vectors of the transfer). Set to 1 by the Initial Velocity
            Routine, INITVEL (the only routine which calls LAMBERT)
            whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset) target
            vector which lies inside the cone"; reset to 0 by INITVEL
            whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset) target
            vector which lies outside "the cone". ("The cone" is a
            mathematically-defined cone whose vertex is the origin of
            coordinates, whose axis is the 180° transfer direction, and
            whose semi-cone angle is specified to INITVEL.) The
            semi-cone angle is set to 15° by P34, P35, P38, P39, P74,
            P75, P78, and P79, because active vehicle transfer angles
            between 165° and 195° are normally avoided in the targeting
            procedure, However, if a transfer angle falling within this
            180° ± 15° sector is intentionally selected by any one of
            the above targeting programs, or by the results from any one
            of the above maneuver program during an intercept trajectory
            targeted for more than 180°, the Lambert Aim Point Maneuver
            Prethrust Routine increases the semi-cone angle to 45° so
            that active vehicle transfer angle will not change from
            inside to outside the cone angle during the powered
            maneuver. Such a condition is undesirable since the
            intercept trajectory would be retargeted during the powered
            maneuver. Likewise, if the initial transfer central angle
            falls outside the 15° semi-cone angle, the semi-cone angle
            is decreased to 10° to reduce the possibility of a transfer
            angle changing from outside to inside the cone during a
            powered maneuver. NORMSW is set to 0 by P31 and P37 because
            the semi-cone angle should be set to 10° for these programs.
            NORMSW should generally remain 0, unless transfers between
            165° and 195° are intended. NORMSW is equivalent to the
            switch f<sub>2</sub> of section 5.5, and to the switch S<sub>R</sub>
            of section 5.3.3 of this GSOP. <br>

    CDUX (outer gimbal) CDUY(inner gimbal) CDUZ (middle gimbal):&nbsp;
    The actual values of the IMU CDU angles.&nbsp; Each register is an
    unsigned 15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated by
    counter interrupts.&nbsp; A middle gimbal angle greater than 70
    degrees will light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. Whenever the
    magnitude of the MGA exceeds 85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop
    will be disabled except during Average-G when the "config" window of
    DAPDATR1 indicates Saturn configuration.&nbsp; As a result, the CDUZ
    register should maintain values that correspond to middle gimbal
    angles between -70 degrees and +70 degrees.<br>

    CDUT.&nbsp; The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled

    ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP on).&nbsp;
    ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e. the outputs
    from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw, about the
    control axes.&nbsp; These axes are aligned with the RCS jet quads
    and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV base axes,
    -7.25 degrees about +X.&nbsp; ADOTs are scaled,
    (degrees/second)/450.&nbsp; OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured
    roll rate obtained by back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA)
    measurements every 0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>.&nbsp;










    This quantity will normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet
    failed-on could produce 2-3°/sec rates.&nbsp; OMEGABs in words 12
    and 13, are the measured attitude rates about the pitch and yaw body
    axes, obtained by transforming the back-differenced CDU readings
    taken each DAP sample period.&nbsp; OMEGAYB is computed each pitch
    DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each yaw DAP pass.&nbsp; The first
    OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started (or after a hardware
    restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample periods.&nbsp; The time
    sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as for the OMEGACs,
    described in words 85-87 of the Powered List.&nbsp; The maximum
    OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec.<br>

    information. Bits 15-11 are flip-flop bits (which are reset by a
    channel "write" command)<br>
    that are also reset when a restart is encountered.<br>
    <br>
    Bit assignments are as follows:<br>

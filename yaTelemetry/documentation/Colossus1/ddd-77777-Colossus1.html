    <p>CSM STATE VECTOR and TIME. The CMC's latest calculated state
      vector for the CSM in either earth-centered or moon-centered
      reference coordinates. During the Orbital Integration Routine, the
      sphere of influence will be indicated by Flagword 8, bit 12
      (CMOONFLG): zero = earth-centered; one = lunar-centered, It is
      important to note that the Average-G routine is initialized with a
      state in RN, VN which can have a different origin than is
      indicated by CMOONFLG. This means an inconsistency in the Downlink
      of the state vector actual origin and CMOONFLG origin. Words 2-4
      contain the position components, X, Y, Z, scaled meters/2<sup>29</sup>,
      Words 5-7 contain the velocity components, X, Y, Z, scaled
      (meters/centisecond)/2<sup>7</sup>. Word 8 contains the time
      associated with the CSM state vector in words 2-7, scaled
      centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>, referenced to the computer clock.
      These parameters are calculated whenever the CSM state vector is
      permanently extrapolated or changed, as follows: <br>

    <p>CDUX (outer gimbal) CDUY (inner gimbal) CDUZ (middle gimbal): The
      actual values of the IMU CDU angles. Each register is an unsigned
      15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and is updated by counter
      interrupts. A middle gimbal angle greater than 70 degrees will
      light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the DSKY. Whenever the magnitude of
      the MGA exceeds 85 degrees the ISS stabilization loop will be
      disabled. As a result, the CDUZ register should maintain values
      that correspond to middle gimbal angles between -70 degrees and
      +70 degrees.<br>

    <p>CDUT. The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled (degrees -
      19.7754)/45 (two's complement). The angle varies from -19.775° to
      +45°. <br>

    <p>ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP on).
      ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e. the
      outputs from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw, about
      the control axes. These axes are aligned with the RCS jet quads
      and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV base axes,
      -7.25 degrees about +X. ADOTs are scaled, (degrees/second)/450.
      OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured roll rate obtained by
      back-differencing the outer gimbal angle (OGA) measurements every
      0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>, This quantity will
      normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet failed-on could
      produce 2-3°/sec rates. OMEGABS, in words 12 and 13, are the
      measured pitch and yaw attitude rates about the body axes,
      obtained by back-differencing the CDU readings every TVC DAP
      sample period. The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the
      same as for the OMEGACs, described in words 85-87 of the Powered
      downlist. The maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec. <br>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: Even though the TVC zeroing loop treats OGARATE as a single
      precision quantity, it will be transmitted and considered as a
      double precision quantity in which the low-order register will
      always be zero. This is due to the fact that OGARATE = OMEGAXB and
      after zeroing OMEGAXB and OMEGAYB, as part of the TVC zeroing
      loop, OGARATE is computed and stored in DP. <br>

    <p>AKs. The X, Y and Z (roll, pitch and yaw, respectively) attitude
      errors used to drive the FDAI display, scaled degrees/180, The
      roll attitude error register (AK +0) is loaded with one-quarter
      the "raw" value during P11 (and entry programs while Entry DAP is
      running, although the cell is not telemetered then) to increase
      the scale by a factor of four. The attitude errors are about the
      control axes for RCS DAP and about the body axes for TVC and Entry
      DAP. Zeros in bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in bit 2 of
      Flagword 6 indicate that the Entry DAP is active, During RCS DAP
      operation the particular error quantities depend upon the display
      mode selected, as follows: MODE 1 (selected by V61) results in
      Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected by V62) results in
      total attitude errors with respect to the angles in N22; MODE 3
      (selected by V63) results in total astronaut attitude errors with
      respect to the angles in N17, In MODE 1 the errors should
      generally remain less than the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5
      degree or 5 degrees as selected in DAPDATR1). The values are
      calculated every 200 ms during RCS DAP operation, whereas in TVC
      DAP operation, AK is updated every 0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE
      with the current value of OGA, and AK 1 and AK 2 are updated every
      TVC DAP sample period (in PCOPY and YCOPY) with the respective
      values of ERRBTMP. Also, with TVC DAP, AK will normally have a
      magnitude of less than 5 degrees but a jet failed-on could produce
      up to 30 degrees. AK 1 and AK 2 will normally have peak values of
      up to 10 degrees, converging to 0-4 degrees with time.<br>

            whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset) target
            vector which lies inside the cone"; reset to 0 by INITVEL
            whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset) target
            vector which lies outside "the cone". ("The cone" is a
            mathematically-defined cone whose vertex is the origin of
            coordinates, whose axis is the 180° transfer direction, and
            whose semi-cone angle is specified to INITVEL.) The
            semi-cone angle is set to 15° by P34, P35, P38, P39, P74,
            P75, P78, and P79, because active vehicle transfer angles
            between 165° and 195° are normally avoided in the targeting
            procedure, However, if a transfer angle falling within this
            180° ± 15° sector is intentionally selected by any one of
            the above targeting programs, or by the results from any one
            of the above maneuver program during an intercept trajectory
            targeted for more than 180°, the Lambert Aim Point Maneuver
            Prethrust Routine increases the semi-cone angle to 45° so
            that active vehicle transfer angle will not change from
            inside to outside the cone angle during the powered
            maneuver. Such a condition is undesirable since the
            intercept trajectory would be retargeted during the powered
            maneuver. Likewise, if the initial transfer central angle
            falls outside the 15° semi-cone angle, the semi-cone angle
            is decreased to 10° to reduce the possibility of a transfer
            angle changing from outside to inside the cone during a
            powered maneuver. NORMSW is set to 0 by P31 and P37 because
            the semi-cone angle should be set to 10° for these programs.
            NORMSW should generally remain 0, unless transfers between

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stand for
      the first digit of the verb display, etc.&nbsp; For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB.&nbsp;
      For the left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the
      LSB.&nbsp; Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete
      information, a one indicating that the discrete is on.&nbsp; For
      example, a one in bit 11 of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus
      sign.&nbsp; If the sign bits associated with a given register are
      both zeros, then the content of that particular register is octal;
      if either of the bits is set, the register content is decimal

    <p>ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP
      on).&nbsp; ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e.
      the outputs from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw,
      about the control axes.&nbsp; These axes are aligned with the RCS
      jet quads and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV
      base axes, -7.25 degrees about +X.&nbsp; ADOTs are scaled,
      (degrees/second)/450.&nbsp; OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured
      roll rate obtained by back-differencing the outer gimbal angle
      (OGA) measurements every 0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>.&nbsp;








      This quantity will normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet
      failed-on could produce 2-3°/sec rates.&nbsp; OMEGABs in words 12
      and 13, are the measured attitude rates about the pitch and yaw
      body axes, obtained by transforming the back-differenced CDU
      readings taken each DAP sample period.&nbsp; OMEGAYB is computed
      each pitch DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each yaw DAP pass.&nbsp;
      The first OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started (or after a
      hardware restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample periods.&nbsp;
      The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as for the
      OMEGACs, described in words 85-87 of the Powered List.&nbsp; The
      maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec.<br>

      DAP.&nbsp; Zeros in bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in

      During RCS DAP operation the particular error quantities depend
      upon the display mode selected, as follows:&nbsp; MODE 1 (selected
      by V61) results in Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected
      in V62) results in total attitude errors with respect to the
      angles in N22; MODE 3 (selected by V63) results in total astronaut
      attitude errors with respect to the angles in N17.&nbsp; In MODE 1
      the errors should generally remain less than the attitude
      deadband, ADB, (either 0.5 degree or 5 degrees as selected in
      DAPDATR1).&nbsp; The values are calculated every 200 ms during RCS
      DAP operation, whereas in TVC DAP operation, AK is updated every
      0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE with the complement of OGAERROR, and
      AK 1 and AK 2 are updated every TVC DAP sample period (in PCOPY
      and YCOPY) with the respective values of ERRBTMP.&nbsp; The error
      needles themselves, however, are updated with AKs only every
      one-half second on a call from TVC EXECUTIVE.&nbsp; Also, with TVC
      DAP, AK will normally have a magnitude of less than 5 degrees but
      a jet failed-on could produce a diverging roll attitude.&nbsp; AK1
      and AK2 will normally have peak values of up to 3 degrees,
      converging to 0-1 degrees with time.<br>

    <p>ERRORX, ERRORY, ERRORZ. The RCS DAP phase plane (roll, pitch,
      yaw) attitude errors scaled degrees/180. During steady state
      operation the magnitude of ERRORX, Y, and Z should be less than
      the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5 deg. or 5 deg.). When the
      CMC mode switch is in AUTO or HOLD, a magnitude greater than the
      ADB which exists for long intervals without diminishing at the
      rate as specified in DAPDATR1 would be an indication of bad RCS
      DAP performance. The RCS control axes, with which these errors are
      concerned, are rotated, with respect to the body axes, by -7.25
      degrees about the +X axis. The error values are calculated: <br>

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stand for
      the first digit of the verb display, etc.&nbsp; For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB.&nbsp;
      For the left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the
      LSB.&nbsp; Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete
      information, a one indicating that the discrete is on.&nbsp; For
      example, a one in bit 11 of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus
      sign.&nbsp; If the sign bits associated with a given register are
      both zeros, then the content of that particular register is octal;
      if either of the bits is set, the register content is decimal
      data.</p>
    <p>The five bit codes associated with the digits are as follows:<br>

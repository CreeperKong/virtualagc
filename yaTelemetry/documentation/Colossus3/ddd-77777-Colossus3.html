    <p>CSM STATE VECTOR and TIME.&nbsp; The CMC's latest calculated
      state vector for the CSM in either earth-centered or moon-centered
      reference coordinates.&nbsp; During the Orbital Integration
      Routine, the sphere of influence will be indicated by Flagword 8,
      bit 12 (CMOONFLG):&nbsp; zero = earth-centered; one =
      lunar-centered.&nbsp; It is important to note that the Average G
      routine is initialized with a state in RN, VN which can have a
      different origin than is indicated by CMOONFLG.&nbsp; Bit 2 of
      Flagword 0 (AMOONFLG) indicates sphere of influence for Average G
      state vector: 0 = earth-centered, 1 = lunar-centered.&nbsp; Words
      2-4 contain the position components X, Y, Z, scaled meters/2<sup>29</sup>.&nbsp;








      Words 5-7 contain the velocity components X, Y, Z, scaled
      (meters/centisecond)/2<sup>7</sup>.&nbsp; Word 8 contains the time
      associated with the CSM state vector in words 2-7, scaled
      centimeters/2<sup>28</sup>, referenced to the computer
      clock.&nbsp; These parameters are calculated whenever the CSM
      state vector is permanently extrapolated or changed, as follows:<br>

    <p>CDUX (outer gimbal) CDUY(inner gimbal) CDUZ (middle
      gimbal):&nbsp; The actual values of the IMU CDU angles.&nbsp; Each
      register is an unsigned 15-bit fraction, scaled degrees/360, and
      is updated by counter interrupts.&nbsp; A middle gimbal angle
      greater than 70 degrees will light the Gimbal Lock lamp on the
      DSKY. Whenever the magnitude of the MGA exceeds 85 degrees the ISS
      stabilization loop will be disabled except during Average-G when
      the "config" window of DAPDATR1 indicates Saturn
      configuration.&nbsp; As a result, the CDUZ register should
      maintain values that correspond to middle gimbal angles between
      -70 degrees and +70 degrees.<br>

    <p>CDUT.&nbsp; The optics trunnion angle CDU, scaled
      (degrees-19.7754)/45 (two's complement).&nbsp; The angle varies

    <p>ADOTs (if RCS DAP on) or OGARATE and OMEGABs (if TVC DAP
      on).&nbsp; ADOTs are the RCS DAP-measured vehicle body rates (i.e.
      the outputs from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw,
      about the control axes.&nbsp; These axes are aligned with the RCS
      jet quads and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV
      base axes, -7.25 degrees about +X.&nbsp; ADOTs are scaled,
      (degrees/second)/450.&nbsp; OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured
      roll rate obtained by back-differencing the outer gimbal angle
      (OGA) measurements every 0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>.&nbsp;








      This quantity will normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet
      failed-on could produce 2-3°/sec rates.&nbsp; OMEGABs in words 12
      and 13, are the measured attitude rates about the pitch and yaw
      body axes, obtained by transforming the back-differenced CDU
      readings taken each DAP sample period.&nbsp; OMEGAYB is computed
      each pitch DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each yaw DAP pass.&nbsp;
      The first OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started (or after a
      hardware restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample periods.&nbsp;
      The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as for the
      OMEGACs, described in words 85-87 of the Powered List.&nbsp; The
      maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>14a,14b,15a</h1>
    <p><i>Same as Powered List.</i></p>
    <p>AKs.&nbsp; The X, Y and Z (roll, pitch and yaw, respectively)
      attitude errors used to drive the FDAI display, scaled
      degrees/180.&nbsp; The roll attitude error register (AK+0) is
      loaded with one-quarter the "raw" value during P11 and entry
      programs while Entry DAP is running, to increase the scale by a
      factor of four.&nbsp; The attitude errors are about the control
      axes for RCS DAP and about the body axes for TVC and Entry
      DAP.&nbsp; Zeros in bits 15, 14 and 13 of DAPDATR1 and a one in
      bit 2 of Flagword 6 indicate that the Entry DAP is active.&nbsp;
      During RCS DAP operation the particular error quantities depend
      upon the display mode selected, as follows:&nbsp; MODE 1 (selected
      by V61) results in Autopilot phase-plane errors; MODE 2 (selected
      in V62) results in total attitude errors with respect to the
      angles in N22; MODE 3 (selected by V63) results in total astronaut
      attitude errors with respect to the angles in N17.&nbsp; In MODE 1
      the errors should generally remain less than the attitude
      deadband, ADB, (either 0.5 degree or 5 degrees as selected in
      DAPDATR1).&nbsp; The values are calculated every 200 ms during RCS
      DAP operation, whereas in TVC DAP operation, AK is updated every
      0.5 second in TVC EXECUTIVE with the complement of OGAERROR, and
      AK 1 and AK 2 are updated every TVC DAP sample period (in PCOPY
      and YCOPY) with the respective values of ERRBTMP.&nbsp; The error
      needles themselves, however, are updated with AKs only every
      one-half second on a call from TVC EXECUTIVE.&nbsp; Also, with TVC
      DAP, AK will normally have a magnitude of less than 5 degrees but
      a jet failed-on could produce a diverging roll attitude.&nbsp; AK1
      and AK2 will normally have peak values of up to 3 degrees,
      converging to 0-1 degrees with time.<br>

    <p>TIG.&nbsp; The time of ignition (prethrust) or time of cutoff
      (while thrusting).&nbsp; The changeover in definition for P40
      occurs at ignition if an impulsive burn and at first TGOCALC
      (nominal TIG+2) if steering.&nbsp; For P15, the changeover occurs
      at ignition+10 seconds.&nbsp; This item is scaled, centiseconds/2<sup>28</sup>.&nbsp;






      This parameter is calculated by P31, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36, P72,
      P73, P74 and P75.&nbsp; P15, P30, P37, P76 and P77 all require TIG
      as input, although P37 may modify TIG based on correction for burn
      interval.&nbsp; In MINKEY P76, TIG is loaded with targeted
      ignition time by MINKEY control logic.&nbsp; If the ignition time
      must be slipped (alarm 1703<sub>8</sub>), P40 or P41 loads this
      word with the new ignition time.&nbsp; After ignition for an
      impulsive burn, TIG is loaded with predicted cutoff time, and
      after the first TGO calculation (long burn) TIG is loaded with the
      state vector time (word 8) plus TGO.&nbsp; After the enter
      response to the flashing verb 97 (engine fail), the most
      significant half of TIG is set to -24<sub>8</sub> and the least
      significant half remains unchanged.<br>

      gimbal-actuator trim angle estimates in the pitch and yaw planes
      (used to align the engine with the vehicle cg), scaled (seconds of
      arc)/(85.41×2<sup>14</sup>).&nbsp; These values are added to the
      DAP filter output every DAP sample period as part of the engine
      gimbal servo command.&nbsp; The variation is usually less than ±2
      degrees over the course of a burn.&nbsp; These are equivalent to
      the upper halves of the double-precision registers, PDELOFF and

      correction time, which is about 3.4 seconds after ignition.&nbsp;
      For the CSM/LM the "one-shot" occurs at TVC initialization and
      hence causes no change to PACTOFF or YACTOFF.&nbsp; Incremental
      changes are made every 0.5 second after the "one-shot" correction
      and an end-of-burn update is made following the engine shut-down

            target vector which lies outside "the cone".&nbsp; ("The
            cone" is a mathematically-defined cone whose vertex is the
            origin of coordinates, whose axis is the 180° transfer
            direction, and whose semi-cone angle is specified to
            INITVEL.)&nbsp; The semi-cone angle is set to 15° by P34,
            P35, P74 and P75 because active vehicle transfer angles
            between 165° and 195° are normally avoided in the targeting
            procedure.&nbsp; However, if a transfer angle falling within
            this 180° ± 15° sector is intentionally selected by any one
            of the above targeting programs, or by the results from any
            one of the above maneuver programs during an intercept
            trajectory targeted for more than 180°, the Lambert Aim
            Point Maneuver Prethrust Routine increases the semi-cone
            angle to 45° so that active vehicle transfer angle will not
            change from inside to outside the cone angle during the
            powered maneuver.&nbsp; Such a condition is undesirable
            since the intercept trajectory would be retargeted during
            the powered maneuver.&nbsp; Likewise, if the initial
            transfer central angle falls outside the 15° semi-cone
            angle, the semi-cone angle is decreased to 10° to reduce the
            possibility of a transfer angle changing from outside to
            inside the cone during a powered maneuver.&nbsp; NORMSW is
            set to 0 by P37 because the semi-cone angle should be set to

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stand for
      the first digit of the verb display, etc.&nbsp; For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB.&nbsp;
      For the left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the
      LSB.&nbsp; Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete
      information, a one indicating that the discrete is on.&nbsp; For
      example, a one in bit 11 of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus
      sign.&nbsp; If the sign bits associated with a given register are
      both zeros, then the content of that particular register is octal;
      if either of the bits is set, the register content is decimal

      the outputs from the RCS DAP rate filter), roll, pitch and yaw,
      about the control axes.&nbsp; These axes are aligned with the RCS
      jet quads and, consequently, are rotated, with respect to the NAV
      base axes, -7.25 degrees about +X.&nbsp; ADOTs are scaled,
      (degrees/second)/450.&nbsp; OGARATE, in word 11, is the measured
      roll rate obtained by back-differencing the outer gimbal angle
      (OGA) measurements every 0.5 second, scaled (rev/sec)/2<sup>-4</sup>.&nbsp;








      This quantity will normally be near zero magnitude but a roll jet
      failed-on could produce 2-3°/sec rates.&nbsp; OMEGABs in words 12
      and 13, are the measured attitude rates about the pitch and yaw
      body axes, obtained by transforming the back-differenced CDU
      readings taken each DAP sample period.&nbsp; OMEGAYB is computed
      each pitch DAP pass; OMEGAZB is computed each yaw DAP pass.&nbsp;
      The first OMEGAZB value when the TVC DAP is started (or after a
      hardware restart) is measured over 1.5 DAP sample periods.&nbsp;
      The time sharing and scaling for OMEGABs are the same as for the
      OMEGACs, described in words 85-87 of the Powered List.&nbsp; The
      maximum OMEGAB rate will be less than 5 deg/sec.<br>

    <p>ERRORX, ERRORY, ERRORZ. The RCS DAP phase plane (roll, pitch,
      yaw) attitude errors scaled degrees/180. During steady state
      operation the magnitude of ERRORX, Y, and Z should be less than
      the attitude deadband, ADB, (either 0.5 deg. or 5 deg.). When the
      CMC mode switch is in AUTO or HOLD, a magnitude greater than the
      ADB which exists for long intervals without diminishing at the
      rate as specified in DAPDATR1 would be an indication of bad RCS
      DAP performance. The RCS control axes, with which these errors are

      degrees about the +X axis. The error values are calculated:<br>

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stand for
      the first digit of the verb display, etc.&nbsp; For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB.&nbsp;
      For the left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the
      LSB.&nbsp; Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete
      information, a one indicating that the discrete is on.&nbsp; For
      example, a one in bit 11 of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus
      sign.&nbsp; If the sign bits associated with a given register are
      both zeros, then the content of that particular register is octal;
      if either of the bits is set, the register content is decimal

    <p>If bits 15 through 12 of DSPTAB+11D are 1000, the last 11 bits
      indicate the state to which the CMC will command the relays; if
      bits 15 through 12 are 0000, the last 11 bits indicate the actual
      state of the relays.&nbsp; A one indicates that the discrete is
      on.&nbsp; A verb 36 fresh start preserves bits 6 and 4, while a
      restart preserves bits 9, 6 and 4.&nbsp; All other bits are
      zeroed.&nbsp; An error reset code preserves bits 6 and 4.</p>
